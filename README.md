# guitarlette

Work in progress.

**Requirements**: Python 3.7+

## What?

This an attempt to write my ideal songwriting app for guitar as well as an experiment using a few different libraries that I find interesting. It relies heavily on [Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette), [Tortoise ORM](https://github.com/tortoise/tortoise-orm), and [pychord](https://github.com/yuma-m/pychord).
