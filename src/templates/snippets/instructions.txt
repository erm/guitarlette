[Instructions]

1. Use this form to compose a song in unlocked mode.

    * Chords and lyrics should be placed on separate lines.

        Example:

        C                    Em
        Mega Guillotine, I love you
        C                      Am          D
        Mega Guillotine, I’m rooting for you

             Em                  D   G   C
        We’re praying for you every day
            Am                 D    C
        We’re praying for you every  day

    * Click the lock icon to enter locked mode, go ahead and try now!

2. Play with the controls in locked mode.

    * Transpose

        Transpose the chords in the song up or down one degree using the chords defined
        in unlocked mode.

    * Scroll

        Play, pause, or stop auto-scrolling the page.

        This can be done using the cursor by clicking one of the buttons, or by 
        using the following keyboard shortcuts:

            [Esc] Stop
            [Space] Play/Pause
            [+/-] Increase/Decrease Speed

    * Font

        Increase or decrease the font-size.

3. Download a text file containing your song.

    * Currently songs are not stored, and they will disappear after leaving this page.
      To save them, you will need to copy/paste the content manually or use the download
      button.

    * I intend to implement at least an import option and potentially some form of
      cloud storage for content.

4. Have fun!

    * There is an option "clear" which will empty this form.
